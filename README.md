## Functional Programming Notes
- Try to return changes of state to the world from your functions. Functions that modify the world should be unit, and try to make one function perform only one unit operation
- Algebraic Data Types are useful, so is pattern matching. 
- Keep functions small and self-contained

## Combinatorial Game Theory Notes
- Game: 
- Types of Games
	- Partial and Impartial
	- Zero Sum and non Zero Sum
	- Perfect and Imperfect information
	-
